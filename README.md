[This little website](http://www.nicole-brewer.com) is my playground for web development. I started out about a year ago with experience at all, but by the power of the internet I've managed to teach myself quite a bit in my free time.
This is a list of what I've accomplished and what I'm currently working on adding to the site:

- [x] Learn basic HTML and CSS
- [x] Use flex-box and media queries to make the menu mobile friendly
- [x] Use JavaScript to create a responsive menu button
- [x] Make the header and footer global using PHP's include
- [x] Set up a mySQL database to house my blog on my server
- [ ] Create an "About" and a "Resume" page
- [ ] Create a blog page that uses my database by connecting to the server

Thanks for visiting!
