# My First Website

This little website was my playground for web development in 2017. At the time, I didn't realize just quite how relevant this project would be to my future work, where I would contribute to the science gateway [MyGeoHub](mygeohub.org). I was able to teach myself HTML, CSS, Sass, and PHP to build this dynamic website. I spent a lot of time on creating a header that shrunk in size as you scrolled down from the top of the page. I also implemented a responsive menu with flexbox.

## Features:

- [x] Learn basic HTML and CSS
- [x] Use flex-box and media queries to make the menu mobile friendly
- [x] Use JavaScript to create a responsive menu button
- [x] Make the header and footer global using PHP's include
- [x] Set up a mySQL database to house my blog on my server
- [ ] Create an "About" and a "Resume" page
- [ ] Create a blog page that uses my database by connecting to the server
